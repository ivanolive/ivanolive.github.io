**Ivan De Oliveira Nunes**

I'm an Assistant Professor of Computing Security at RIT.
Before RIT I've received my Ph.D. from the University of California Irvine (UCI) in 2021.
At UCI I was advised by Prof. Gene Tsudik and a member of the Sprout Lab.
I studied Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES), in Brazil from 2009 to 2014.
I also earned an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) – Brazil in 2016.
While at UFMG, my master’s advisors were Profs. Antonio Loureiro  and Pedro Vaz de Melo.
While at UFES, I worked with lots of folks, but most closely with Prof. Magnos Martinello and Prof. Roberta Lima Gomes.
