## About

I am an Assistant Professor at [RIT](rit.edu) where I'm affiliated with the [Department of Cybersecurity (CSEC)](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computing-security), the [Global Cybersecurity Institute (GCI)](https://www.rit.edu/cybersecurity/facilities), and the [Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences (GCCIS)](https://www.rit.edu/computing/).
I am also a faculty member of the [Computing and Information Sciences Ph.D. program](https://www.rit.edu/study/computing-and-information-sciences-phd).

Before RIT, I received my Ph.D. from the University of California Irvine (UCI), in 2021.
At UCI I was advised by Prof. [Gene Tsudik](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/) and a member of the [Sprout Lab](http://sprout.ics.uci.edu/).
I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Engineering from the Federal University of Espirito Santo, Brazil (UFES) and an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil (UFMG).

## Research Interests

I have a wide range of research interests that encompass various fields, including Security & Privacy, Computer Networking, Embedded Systems, Applied Cryptography, and particularly their intersections. Over the recent years, my research has delved into areas such as IoT/CPS Security, System Security, Software Security, Applied Cryptography, and Networked Systems.

My doctoral dissertation, completed in 2021, focused on the systematic co-design of secure and formally verified security services for resource-constrained embedded systems. These services, such as Remote Attestation, Secure Software Update, and Provable/Guaranteed Code Execution, are designed to maintain their effectiveness even in scenarios where the embedded system's software state is fully compromised.

Here [ComMag'24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04308.pdf) is a (relatively short) paper that provides a high-level overview of my work on remotely verifiable software integrity for embedded devices.
