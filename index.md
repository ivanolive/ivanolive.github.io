## About

I am an Assistant Professor of Cybersecurity at the [University of Zurich (UZH)](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) where I'm affiliated with the [Department of Informatics (IfI)](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en.html). Before UZH, I was an Assistant professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology (2021 - 2025).

I received my Ph.D. from the University of California Irvine (UCI), in 2021.
At UCI I was advised by Prof. [Gene Tsudik](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/) and a member of the [Sprout Lab](http://sprout.ics.uci.edu/).
I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Engineering from the Federal University of Espirito Santo, Brazil (UFES) and an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil (UFMG).

## Research Interests

I have a wide range of research interests that encompass various fields, including Security & Privacy, Computer Networking, Embedded Systems, Applied Cryptography, and particularly their intersections. Over the recent years, my research has delved into areas such as IoT/CPS Security, System Security, Software Security, Applied Cryptography, and Networked Systems.

My doctoral dissertation, completed in 2021, focused on the systematic co-design of secure and formally verified security services for resource-constrained embedded systems. These services, such as Remote Attestation, Secure Software Update, and Provable/Guaranteed Code Execution, are designed to maintain their effectiveness even in scenarios where the embedded system's software state is fully compromised.

Here [[ComMag'24]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04308.pdf) is a (relatively short) paper that provides a high-level overview of our work on remotely verifiable software integrity for embedded devices.
