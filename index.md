## About

I am an Assistant Professor of Computing Security at [RIT](rit.edu).
I'm affiliated with the [Department of Computing Security (CSEC)](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computing-security), the [Global Cybersecurity Institute (GCI)](https://www.rit.edu/cybersecurity/facilities), and the [Golisano Colege of Computing and Information Sciences (GCCIS)](https://www.rit.edu/computing/).
I am also a faculty member of the [Computing and Information Sciences Ph.D. program](https://www.rit.edu/study/computing-and-information-sciences-phd).

Before RIT I received my Ph.D. from the University of California Irvine (UCI), in 2021.
At UCI I was advised by Prof. [Gene Tsudik](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/) and a member of the [Sprout Lab](http://sprout.ics.uci.edu/).
I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Engineering from the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES).
I also earned an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).
While at UFMG, my master’s advisors were Profs. [Antonio Loureiro](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~loureiro/)  and [Pedro Vaz de Melo](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~olmo/wordpress/).
While at UFES, I worked with lots of folks, but most closely with Prof. [Magnos Martinello](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~magnos/) and Prof. [Roberta Lima Gomes](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~rgomes/index_e.html).

## Research Interests

My research interests span the fields of Security & Privacy, Computer Networking, Embedded Systems, Applied Cryptography, and especially their intersection.
In recent years, I’ve worked on CPS Security, Content-Centric Networking Security, Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) with applications to Blockchain technologies, Biometric-Based Authentication and Identification, and Opportunistic Mobile Networking.

My Ph.D. dissertation (2021) focused on the systematic hardware/software co-design of trustworthy and formally verified security services for resource-constrained embedded systems.
Examples of such services include Remote Attestation, Secure Software Update, and Provable/Guaranteed Code Execution.
They are designed to remain effective even under the assumption of full compromise of the embedded system’s software state.
