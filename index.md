## About

I'm an Assistant Professor of Computing Security at RIT.
I'm affiliated with the Department of Computing Security (CSEC), the Global Cybersecurity Institute (GCI), and the Golisano Colege of Computing and Information Sciences (GCCIS).

Before RIT I received my Ph.D. from the University of California Irvine (UCI), in 2021.
At UCI I was advised by Prof. [Gene Tsudik](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/) and a member of the [Sprout Lab](http://sprout.ics.uci.edu/).
I hold a B.S. degree in Computer Engineering from the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES).
I also earned an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).
While at UFMG, my master’s advisors were Profs. [Antonio Loureiro](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~loureiro/)  and [Pedro Vaz de Melo](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~olmo/wordpress/).
While at UFES, I worked with lots of folks, but most closely with Prof. [Magnos Martinello](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~magnos/) and Prof. [Roberta Lima Gomes](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~rgomes/index_e.html).

## Research Interests

My research interests span the fields of Security & Privacy, Computer Networking, Embedded Systems, Applied Cryptography, and especially their intersection.
In recent years, I’ve worked on CPS Security, Content-Centric Networking Security, Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) with applications to Blockchain technologies, Biometric-Based Authentication and Identification, and Opportunistic Mobile Networking.

My Ph.D. dissertation (2021) focused on the systematic hardware/software co-design of trustworthy and formally verified security services for resource-constrained embedded systems.
Examples of such services include Remote Attestation, Secure Software Update, and Provable Guarantees Code Execution.
They are designed to remain effective even under the assumption of full compromise of the embedded system’s software state.
