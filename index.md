## About

I'm an Assistant Professor of Computing Security at RIT.
At RIT I'm affiliated with the Department of Computing Security (CSEC), the Global Cybersecurity Institute (GCI) and the Golisano Colege of Computing and Information Sciences (GCCIS).

Before RIT I've received my Ph.D. from the University of California Irvine (UCI) in 2021.
At UCI I was advised by Prof. Gene Tsudik and a member of the Sprout Lab.
I studied Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES), in Brazil from 2009 to 2014.
I also earned an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) – Brazil in 2016.
While at UFMG, my master’s advisors were Profs. Antonio Loureiro  and Pedro Vaz de Melo.
While at UFES, I worked with lots of folks, but most closely with Prof. Magnos Martinello and Prof. Roberta Lima Gomes.

## Research Interests

My research interests span the fields of Security/Privacy, Computer Networking, Embedded Systems, Applied Cryptography, and especially their intersection.
In recent years, I’ve worked on CPS Security, Content-Centric Networking Security, Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) with applications to Blockchain technologies, Biometric-Based Authentication and Identification, and Opportunistic Mobile Networking.

My Ph.D. dissertation was mostly focused on systematic hardware/software co-design of trustworthy and formally verified security services for resource-constrained IoT devices. Examples of such services are Remote Attestation, Secure Software Update, and Provable Code Execution.
These services are designed to remain effective even under the assumption of full compromise of the IoT device’s software state.
